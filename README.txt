Phylogenetic Analysis by Andrew Klock

This package will allow the user to query NCBI with any number of DNA, RNA, or Protein accession numbers.
After returning the output of the query, a phylogenetic analysis will be initiated on the query results.
An eternity will pass but eventually the results of the phylogenetic analysis will be presented.
The phylogenetic tree is rudimentary but accurate.
If you were awesome enough to run a protein query, then a long printout of an analysis of your proteins will follow.
Use that awesome information to do some even more awesome science!

Thanks for checking my code out.
